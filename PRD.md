# PRD.md — JinaCampus First Development PRD

## 1. Product Overview
JinaCampus is a production-grade, multi-tenant School Management SaaS for Indian schools.

Brand:

> JinaCampus - The Complete School OS, powered by Parshwa Insights

The first development phase creates the foundation for a reliable school operations platform with secure tenant isolation, role-based access, audit logs, student academic records, student attendance, staff profiles, QR-based staff attendance, and a lightweight attendance notification foundation.

## 2. First Development Goal
Build the initial production-ready foundation for:

1. CampusCore
2. Academia
3. StaffBoard Lite

The goal is to deliver a strong modular monolith foundation that can later support GradeBook, FeeDesk, SchoolCast, InsightBoard, CampusFleet, BookNest, AssetRoom, full StaffBoard HR, and mobile apps.

## 3. Non-Goals for First Development
Do not build the following in this phase:

- Fee collection
- Receipts
- Exams
- Marks entry
- Report cards
- Full SchoolCast communication module, except the approved disabled-by-default attendance notification foundation
- Advanced dashboards
- Payroll
- Payroll-linked leave settlement (staff leave applications and basic balances are approved separately)
- Biometric attendance
- Transport
- Library
- Inventory
- Native mobile apps

## 3.1 Strategic Decision — Base Application Polish Before New Modules
Before starting the next product MVP module such as FeeDesk, GradeBook, or SchoolCast, JinaCampus will complete a Base Application Polish & Usability Hardening phase.

Reason: the current MVP foundation is technically strong, but a school SaaS must feel smooth, reliable, mobile-friendly, and demo-ready before expanding into additional business modules.

### Phase 9 Overview

1. 9.1 Core Edit Flows
2. 9.2 Form UX Polish
3. 9.3 Empty / Loading / Error State Polish
4. 9.4 Table and Filter Polish
5. 9.5 Role-Based Navigation Polish
6. 9.6 Dashboard UX Polish
7. 9.7 Authenticated Mobile QA
8. 9.8 Demo Seed Data
9. 9.9 Final Base MVP Smoke Checklist

### Phase 9 Non-Goals

- FeeDesk
- GradeBook
- SchoolCast
- Native mobile app
- Payroll
- Biometric attendance
- Exports/charts unless explicitly requested

### Phase 9 User Experience Goals

- Smoother create/edit forms with clear validation and actions.
- Clearer role-based navigation for principal/admin, teacher, and staff users.
- Better mobile usage across attendance, QR, reports, and dashboard flows.
- Better empty, loading, and error states across core pages.
- Stronger demo readiness through safe seeded data and smoke checklists.

## 4. Target Users and Roles

JinaCampus uses five canonical operational roles. A human signs in through one
tenant-scoped user account and may hold multiple role assignments; effective
permissions are merged server-side.

### 4.0 JinaCampus Administrator
Manages school tenants, School IDs, platform lifecycle, and platform audit/governance through the separate administrator portal. This operator-only role is provisioned separately and cannot be assigned by a school principal.

### 4.1 Principal
Manages school settings, branches, users, students, staff, attendance, and reports inside authorized tenant and branch scope. A Principal may assign only Office Staff, Teacher, and Staff roles.

### 4.2 Office Staff
Performs explicitly permitted branch operations such as QR generation, attendance correction, and attendance reports. Office Staff receives no user or role governance by default.

### 4.3 Teacher
Views assigned class-sections and students, marks student attendance, and uses self staff-attendance workflows where linked to a staff profile.

### 4.4 Staff
Uses own QR attendance, own attendance status, and account access only unless an additional role grants more permissions.

Parent and student account portals remain deferred. Legacy role codes are migration aliases only and are not new operational roles.

### 4.5 Fast Login

- School users enter School ID plus employee code or email.
- A registered passkey is the preferred fast-login method.
- Employee-code/email and case-sensitive password remains a permanent fallback.
- Passkeys require HTTPS, are tenant-scoped, and never send biometric data to JinaCampus.
- Authorization is always resolved from server-side role and permission assignments; users never select a role to grant themselves access.
- A temporary password marked for change must be replaced before passkey enrollment.

## 5. Core Product Principles

1. Tenant-safe by default
2. Permission-gated by default
3. Audit-ready for sensitive changes
4. Financial-module-ready, but no finance implementation yet
5. Academic-year-aware for academic records
6. Branch-aware for school operations
7. Clean UI for daily school staff usage
8. Extensible module structure
9. Strong server-side validation
10. Production-grade code organization

- `HALF_DAY`
- `ON_LEAVE`
- `EXCUSED`
- `NOT_MARKED`

### Student Attendance Rules

- One active student enrollment receives one attendance record per school day for `FULL_DAY`.
- Unique key: `tenantId + academicYearId + studentId + attendanceDate + sessionType`.
- Teachers can mark only assigned class-sections.
- Admins can mark any class-section within assigned branch scope.
- After cutoff/lock, correction requires admin/principal permission and reason.
- Absence alert placeholder is created for `ABSENT`, and optionally `LATE` / `HALF_DAY` based on settings.

### Academia Acceptance Criteria

- Student records are tenant-scoped.
- Admission number is unique within tenant.
- Student registration validates required admission-sheet fields server-side.
- Full Aadhaar and bank account numbers are not exposed or stored as plaintext; only masked references and last-four digits are retained until approved encrypted storage exists.
- Enrollments are academic-year-scoped.

- Attendance submission is transactional.
- Duplicate attendance records are prevented.
- Attendance correction stores before/after values in audit log.

- `PEON`
- `CLEANING_STAFF`
- `MANAGEMENT`
- `OTHER`

### Staff Attendance Method
The MVP uses QR Scan-based Check-in / Check-out Attendance.

### Staff QR Attendance Flow

```txt
Staff arrives at school
→ Staff opens JinaCampus on mobile
→ Staff scans active QR code displayed at school/gate/office
→ System validates tenant, branch, user, QR token, purpose, and time window
→ Check-in is recorded
→ Late rule is applied automatically
→ Staff scans again at departure
→ Check-out is recorded
→ Working duration is calculated
→ Final status is generated
→ Audit log is created
```

### QR Rules

- QR code is tenant-scoped.
- QR code is branch-scoped.
- QR code is time-bound.
- Default QR validity is 180 seconds.
- Raw token must not be stored; store token hash.
- Staff must be authenticated before scanning.
- Duplicate check-in must be prevented.
- Expired QR must be rejected.
- Wrong-branch QR must be rejected unless explicitly allowed.
- Manual correction requires reason and permission.

### Staff Attendance Statuses

- `PRESENT`
- `ABSENT`
- `LATE`
- `HALF_DAY`
- `ON_LEAVE`
- `WEEK_OFF`
- `HOLIDAY`
- `NOT_MARKED`

### Staff Attendance Sources

- `QR_SCAN`
- `MANUAL_ADMIN`
- `IMPORT`
- `BIOMETRIC`

Only `QR_SCAN` and `MANUAL_ADMIN` are implemented in first development. `IMPORT` and `BIOMETRIC` are enum values for future readiness only.

### StaffBoard Lite Acceptance Criteria

- Staff profile is tenant-scoped and branch-scoped.
- Employee code is unique within tenant.
- QR token generation requires permission.
- QR scan requires authenticated staff user.
- QR token expiry is enforced.
- QR token hash is stored, not raw token.
- Check-in/check-out are transactional.
- Late and half-day status are calculated from branch attendance settings.
- Manual correction requires reason and audit log.
- Leave applicants are resolved from the authenticated user's linked staff profile.
- Leave types, approvers, policy, balances, and applications are tenant- and branch-scoped.
- Leave totals, working dates, balance usage, and attendance status are calculated server-side.
- Approval is transactional and rejects overlapping leave, insufficient balance, required-document gaps, and conflicting attendance.
- Approved full-day leave is synchronized as `ON_LEAVE`; approved half-day leave is synchronized as `HALF_DAY`.
- Staff can withdraw pending applications; authorized approvers can cancel only future approved leave without attendance activity.
- Every leave state, policy, approver, balance, and document change is audited.
- WhatsApp leave updates are disabled by default and require branch enablement, staff consent, an active template, and notification processing.
